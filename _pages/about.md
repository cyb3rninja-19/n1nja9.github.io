Hi, my name is Abhishek. I'm a cybersecurity consultant with a passion for exploring how technology works and can be hacked. My main areas of interest are Application Security (AppSec), Infra Pentesting, Red Teaming, and other forms of Offensive Security.

Since childhood, I've been curious about how things work, and especially how they can be broken. This curiosity led me to a career in securing not only software and networks but also physical systems and critical infrastructure.

In this blog, I'll share my experiences and thoughts on cybersecurity, from vulnerabilities and hacking techniques to practical tips on defense. I hope you find something useful here, and I'd love to connect and chat about all things cybersecurity!
