Hi, my name is ABHISHEK. I work as a Cyber Security Consultant and have a passion for exploring how technology works and can be hacked! 

My main area of interests lie in - <b>Application Security (AppSec), Infra Pentesting, Red Teaming</b> and other forms of <b>Offensive Security</b> 

I’ve always been curious about how things work from my childhood —especially how they can be broken. Over time, this curiosity has driven me to dive deep into securing not only software and networks but also physical systems and critical infrastructure.

In this blog, I share my experiences and thoughts on the cybersecurity, from vulnerabilities and hacking techniques to practical tips on defense. I hope you find something useful here, and I’d love to connect and chat about all things cybersecurity.
