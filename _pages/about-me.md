Hi, my name is <b>ABHISHEK (aka n1nja9)🥷🏻</b> — a cybersecurity consultant, curious hacker, and a goal chaser.


I’ve always been curious about how things work from my childhood —especially how they can be broken. Over time, this curiosity has driven me to dive deep into securing not only software and networks but also physical systems and critical infrastructure.


In this blog, I share my experiences and thoughts on the cybersecurity, from vulnerabilities and hacking techniques to practical tips on defense. I hope you find something useful here, and I’d love to connect and chat about all things cybersecurity.

Vulnerability Management, Application Pentesting

📌 <b>Current Focus</b>

- Leveling up in Web app, API and Mobile App Hacking

🧠 <b>Personal Philosophy</b>

Research like a scholar, think like a hacker, and learn like a kid.

“Improve at least 1% every day.”


Research | Train | Hack | Repeat!
